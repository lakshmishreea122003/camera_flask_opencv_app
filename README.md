# camera_flask_opencv_app

## What is this project about?
In this project, I have used Flask and OpenCV to add filters to the frames of the video.
This project combines the power of Flask and OpenCV to create a user-friendly application where users can apply various filters to video frames. It provides an interactive and intuitive interface for experimenting with different filters and enhancing the visual appeal of images.

## What is in this project?
The UI shows up the video and several filter options which can be applied to the video frame by the user.
